# Defence in Depth Security Architecture – 10

 - **Uniform Protection:** Flat network
 -	Same level of protection for all systems
 -	Over protective
 -	Expensive & complex

 -	**Protective Enclaves:** Varied Protection
    -	Network segmented 
    -	Logical segments, Corp, DC, PCI Ops
 -	**Threat Analysis-Based Design:** Segment based on threat
    -	Review each threat and resolve it by design 
    -	Needs constant review for emerging threats
 -	**Information-Based Design:** - Segment based on data classification
    -	Public, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret

### Control Types and Classifications
**Types**  
-	**Technical** - Firewalls, ACLs
-	**Administrative** Dual controls, Processes, Training
-	**Physical** Barriers, Fences 
-	*Some will count Legal as a 4th control*

**Classification**    
-	**Preventative Controls:**  Firewalls, Guards
-	**Detective:** Logs, IDS, motion sensors
-	**Corrective:** IPS, Account lockouts, Patching  

**Segmentation** – Effective, secure, manageable  

**Product Diversity:** Different manufacturers so not to be dependant  

-	**Single Firewall** 
    -	One Fire wall
    -	One large flat network
    -	No segmentation
-	**Multi Homed Firewall** 
    -	One Fire wall
    -	Multiple Segments
-	**Dual Firewall**
    -	Two Fire walls
    -	Multiple Segments
    -	One Firewall either side of DMZ
    
### Secure Network Design & Outsourcing

-	**Remote Services** - via public internet. Think SSH to EC2(Client to Cloud)
-	**Directly Connected Remote Network** - Site to Site VPN(Direct Connect)

### Secure Data Analytics

-	**SECaaS** – Security as a Service
-	**Data aggregation & correlation:** Combines syslogs, applogs, event logs centrally(SIEM)
-	**Trend Analysis:** Compares the current state to a baseline or trend
-	**Historical Analysis:** Data over time, can be used to create baselines

### Policy’s, Processes & Standards
-	Separation of Duties
-	Background Checks
-	Mandatory Vacations
-	Succession Planning
-	Termination
-	Cross Training
-	Dual Controls 

### Outsourcing
-	Propper vetting
-	Employment Practices
-	Access Control
-	Data ownership & Control
-	Incident response & Notification Requirements

### Reviewing Architecture
-	**Operational View:** How functions are performing, processes
-	**Technical View:** Focuses on technology, settings, configs
-	**Logical View:** How systems interconnect, network maps
