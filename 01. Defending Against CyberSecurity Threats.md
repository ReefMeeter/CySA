# Defending Against Cybersecurity Threats - 1

Risk = Threat x Vulnerability

### <u>NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1</u> - Risk Assesment
- **Step 1** - Prepare for the Assessment
- **Step 2** - Conduct Assessment
  - Identify Threat Sources and Events
  - Identify Vulnerability and Predisposing Conditions
  - Determine Likelihood of Occurrence
  - Determine Magnitude of Impact
  - Determine Risk
- **Step 3** - Communicate Results
- **Step 4** - Maintain Assessment

### <u>Types of Threats</u>
- **Adversarial Threats** - Deliberate disruption, people, groups, competitors 
- **Accidental Threats** - Human error
- **Structural Threats** - When Components/Systems fail. When equipment, software, HVAC, Hardware fail due to age or error 
- **Environmental Threats** - Natural or Man-Made disaster, out of control of the organisation 

### <u>NAC 802.1X</u>
  - **Suplicant** - Client
  - **Authenticator** - Switch
  - **RADIUS Server** - Authentication Server
- **Agent Based** - Software client on a workstation
- **Agentless** - Web Browser
- **In Band** - Dedicated appliance, sits between the devices (inline)
- **Out of Band** - Leverages existing network infrastructure

### <u>Controls</u>
- Temporal (TOD)
- Role Based
- Location
- System Health

### <u>Firewalls</u>
- **Stateless** - Packet filter
- **Stateful** - Monitors state 
- **NGFW** - Contextual
- **WAF** - layer 7, Application 

### <u>Penetration Testing - NIST SP 800-115</u>
1. **Planning** - Timing, Scope, Authorization. No technical work
2. **Discovery** - Gather Publicly available data and Scan target
3. **Attack** - Gain access, Escalate Privilege, Browse files, Install tools
4. **Reporting** - Document and present finding
- **Red Team** - Offensive
- **Blue Team** - Defensive
- **White Team** - Referee

### <u>Reverse Engineering</u>
- **Isolation/Sandboxing** - Sandbox executes and monitors behaviour. Looks for scanning. Good for 0Day & APT attacks
- **Interpreted Code** - Python, Ruby, PHP – Can read
- **Compiled Code** - C, C++ Java – Compiled to bit code
- **Hardware** - Different as code exists in firmware
- **Decomposition** - philosophy where the reverse engineer starts with the finished product and works his way back to its component parts.
- **Code detonation** - suspicious code is automatically sandboxed and monitored for signs of malicious behavior.
- **Disassembly** - from machine code to Assembly
- **Decompilation** - from machine code to an educated guess at the source code

Starting Byte Sequences:  
- Windows: 5A 4D/4D 5A
- Linux: 7F 45 4C 46
