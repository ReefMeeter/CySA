# Analysing Symptoms for Incident Response - 6

## Analysing Network Events

### Router Based Monitoring 
 - **Netflow** - Takes samples every 1 of 100 or 1 of 1000, shows flow. Other tools sFlow, jFlow
 - **RMON** - Shows stats, flow, history & alarms. Layer 1-4, Client-Server, probs MIB (Management Info Base)
 - **SNMP** - Collects info from network appliances. Health, network, device & flow data. V3 is best.
 
### Active Monitoring
 - **Ping** - ICMP, up/down
 - **iPerf** - Measures max bandwidth, used to establish bandwidth
 
### Passive Monitoring
 - **PRTG** - Passler Router Traffic Grapher (Dashboard)
    - Packet Sniffing
    - Flows
    - SNMP
    - WMI – Windows Management Instrument (Scripting Interface) 
- **Solar Winds** 
    - Network traffic analyser – Bandwidth
    - Network performance monitor – Stats, fault detection
- **Nagios** 
    - Syslog monitoring tool
    - Review issues on severity 
- **Cacti** 
    - Network Polling via SNMP
    - Displays device status (Health) 
    
### Detecting Common Network Issues

 - **Bandwidth Consumption** - Can use use PRTG or any flow analysis tools
 - **Link Failure** - SNMP can detect
 - **Beconing** - IDS or IPS can detect
 - **Unexpected Traffic** 
   - Baseline/Anomaly based detection
   - Heuristics
   - Protocol Analysis

### Handeling Network Probs & Attacks

 - **DoS** - Use performance monitoring. IDS, IPS with DoS protection. CDN
 - **Detecting Other Attacks** - IDS/P, Netflow, SIEM
 - **Rogue Devices** - Mac checking, Mac vendor, Scanning, Traffic analysis 
   -  Wired Rogues: NAC, Port security , 802.1X
   -  Wireless Rogues: Nmap, Wireless Audit.
   
## Investigating Host Issues

 - **Process Monitoring** – CPU Utilization 
 - **Memory Monitoring** – Set monitoring thresholds for memory
    - Memory leaks must patch to resolve or reboot 
- **Drive Capacity Monitoring**
   - Windows: SCOM – Systems Centre Operation Manager. Also SCCM but not real time
   - Linux: Nagios
   
### Systems Resource Monitoring 

**Windows**: tools

 - Performance Monitoring
   - Perfmon – Reports on enery usage, Networking
 - Resource Monitoring
   - Resmon – CPU & Memory 
   
**Linux**: commands

 - **ps** – CPU, Memory, Uptime, Processes
 - **top** – CPU & top memory
 - **df** – Disk usage dump
 - **df -h** – Disk usage dump (human readable)
 - **w** – Whos logged in
 
### Malware & Unauthorised Software  

 -	SCCM
 -	AV
 -	Software & file Blacklists
 -	Application Whitelisting
 -	Removing netcat & nc.exe

## Instigating Service & Application Issues
### Categories of Monitoring
 - **Up/Down** – Running?
 - **Performance** – speed
 - **Transactional** – Actions performed
 - **Application & service logging** – Status of service
**Windows** Services.msc or <code>sc</code> in cmd or <code>Start-Service</code> in ps1  
**Linux** <code>[servicename] status</code> or <code>service-status all</code> or <code>etc/init.d</code>  

Application logs for Windows > Event Viewer  

Application logs for Linux > <code>var/log</code>

### Detecting Attacks
 - Abnormal activity
 - New Accounts
 - Unexpected Output
 - Unexpected outbound communication 
 - Service Interruption 
 - Memory Overflows
