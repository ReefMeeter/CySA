# Identity and Access Management - 11
#### Triple A (AAA)
-	Authorization
-	 Authentication
-	 Accounting
### Identity Systems & Security  Design
**LDAP**  
- Directory based
- Hierarchically organised
    - **OU** – Organisational Unit
    - **CN** – Common Name
    - **DC** – Domain Controller
- Plain text by default, can enable TLS
- Has 3 modes  
  - Anonymous
  - Unauthenticated
  - Username/Password
  
### Authenticated Protocols
- **TACACS+** - Cisco, has flaws with integrity and encryption
- **RADIUS** – Password security is not strong, normally used with IPSec
- **Kerberos** 
- A User (Principle) comprised of 3 elements
    - **Primary** (Username)
    - **Instance** (UID)
    - **Relm** (Domain – group of Principles)

### Single Sign On & Shared Auth Schemes 
**Open ID** – Ope source, used by Google, Amazon & Microsoft
**OAuth** – Used access tokens, often used by APIs
**OpenID Connect** – Authentication layer built using OAuth
**Facebook Connect** – Federated authentication (shared Auth)

### Understanding Issues with Identities
**6 Security Issues**  
1.	**Personal** – Staff training and awareness, Insider Threat
2.	**Endpoints** – Capture Creds, keyloggers, tokens, Administrators at risk
3.	**Server Based** – Target identity servers to exploit AAA services
4.	**Applications** – Apps & services that interact with Identity systems
5.	**Roles** – Rights & privileges that are associated with users or groups

### LDAP Attacks
-	Insecure Binding/Connection, unencrypted LDAP traffic
-	Improper LDAP access controls, allowing read/write permissions to directories 
-	LDAP injection
-	DoS to disrupt auth services for LDAP

### Kerberos Attacks
-	Admin account attacks
-	Kerberos ticket reuse 
-	Pass the ticket attacks – Impersonation of a user
-	Pass the Key – Reuse of keys to acquire tickets
-	Golden Ticket – attacker gets a ticket granting ticket 

### Radius Attacks
-	Session replay
-	Shared secrete, Radius used a shared secrete 
-	DoS, preventing legitimate auth requests
-	Credential based attacks, brute force of shared secrets

### AD Attacks
-	Malware on AD server
-	Phishing of creds from users
-	Privilege escalation 
-	Service account, high privilege
-	Dom/Admin rights
-	Use of legacy protocols
    -	NTLMv1
    -	NetBios
    -	SMB

### Preventing Common Exploits of Identity & Authorization 
-	Impersonation: Identity take over or CSRF
-	MiTM
-	Session Hijacking
-	Privilege Escalation
-	Rootkits
### Account Life Cycle
-	**Creation** – generating accounts
-	**Provisioning** – assigning privilege
-	**Modification** – operational maintenance 
-	**Termination/Deprovisioning** – EOL, Disabled, deleted
### MFA
-	**Knowledge factors** – Something you know - Passwords
-	**Possession Factors** – Something you have - Token
-	**Biometric Factors** – Something you are - Fingerprint
-	**Location Factors** – Somewhere you are – geolocation
### Context-Based Auth
-	IP
-	Location
-	Time of Day
-	Frequency of access
-	Membership of Groups
-	Device Based
### IDaaS – Identity as a service
### Federated Identity Security Consolidation 
-	Identity Provider (IDP) – Organisation using federated access
-	Relaying Party (RP) or Service Provider (SP)
-	Consumer 

User(Consumer) >> website(SP) >> Facebook(IDP)
