### Validating Scan Results

-	Verify results, remove false positives   
-	Document exceptions  
-	Informational results may not be fixed  
-	Other tools should be used – logs, SIEM, Config Management Systems  

- **Dirty Cox:** PrivEsc in Linux kernel

### Network Vulnerability’s

- Missing firmware updates  
- **SLL & TLS Issues**  
  - SSL is out of date, should use TLS  
  - Insecure Cipher use, weak ciphers like RC4 should not be used  
  - **Certificate problems**  
    - Names on certs not the same as server name  
    - Expired certs  
    - Unknown CA, Self signed  
- **DNS**, Disable sub domain query’s to stop amplification attacks  
- **Internal IP Exposure**  
- **VPS Issues** Needs to be patched and strong cyphers  

### Virtualization Vulnerabilities
-	VM Escape
-	Host Patching
-	Guest Issues
-	IoT
-	Virtual Network Issues
