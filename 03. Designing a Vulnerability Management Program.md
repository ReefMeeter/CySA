# Designing a Vulnerability Management Program 

## **<u>PCI DSS</u>**

1.	Internal & External scans
2.	Must run at least quarterly. Or after any significant change to the network
3.	Internal scan must be run be conducted by qualified person
4.	High risk vulnerabilitys must be mitigated until a claen scan can be achived
5.	External scan must be conducted by a Approve Scanning Vendor (ASV)

- Segment systems that deal with cards so only that segment needs to be scanned. 

## **<u>FISMA</u>** - Federal Information Security Management Act  
A law updated in 2004 to codify the authority of the Department of Homeland Security with regard to implementation of information security policies. Uses a matrix of high, med, low X CIA

**Potential impact**  
|Low|Med|High|
|---|---|----|
|**Limited** adverse effects|**Serious** adverse effects| **Severer or Catastrophic** adverse effects|  


**Identifying Scan Targets**
- What classification of data are they
- What services do they offer
- Is it Dev, Prod, Qa or Test

**Determine Scan Frequency**
- Risk appetite 
- Regularity requirements (PCI DSS)
- Technical constraints (Time to scan environment)
- Licencing(Amount of scanners or parallel  scans)
- Business requirements (Performance)

**Tools**
- Nessus, QualysGuard, Rapid 7 Nexpose, OpenVAS, Nikito, Microsoft Security Analyser (MSA) 

**Credentialed scans:** More details can be gathered. Use least privilege  

**Agent based scans:** Local agent installed on asset. Performance & Maintainability issues  

## **Security Content Automation Protocol – SCAP**

| Abbreviation |Name|Use|
|--------------|----|---|
|**CEE**| Common Configuration Enumeration| System Config|
|**CPE**| Common Platform Enumeration | Product names/versions|
|**CVE**| Common Vulnerability Exposure | Software flaws|
|**CVSS**| Common Vulnerability Scoring System| Measurable / Descriptive severity of software flaws|
|**XCCDF**| Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format | Checklist & reporting|
|**OVAL**|Open Vulnerability & Asset Language | Low level testing using checklists|

**Prioritizing Remediation**
- Criticality of the system and information at risk
- Difficulty of remediation
- Severity of the vulnerability (CVSS)
- Exposure of the vulnerability (exposed to the internet or internal resource) 

**Barriers**
- Service degradation – bandwith
- Customer commitments – MOUs – SLAs
- Governance & change management – Red tape
