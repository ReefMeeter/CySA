# Building an Incident Response Plan 

1.	**Preparation**
2.	**Detection & Analysis**
3.	**Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
4.	**Post Incident Activates**

- **Event** - Any observable occurrence in a system
  - Can be good or bad - such as logon event, or incorrect password event
- **Adverse Event** - Any event that has a negative consequence
- **Incidents** - An imminent threat of violation, or a violation, of a security policy, acceptable use policy, or security standard practice

## Detection & Analysis 

### NIST 800-61 - Incident Handling Guide
Four categories for security event indicators 
  1.	**Alerts** - IDS, IPS
  2.	**Logs** - From server/workstation, SIEM, Syslogs
  3.	**Publicly Available Information** - New vulns in the wild
  4.	**People** - report of unusual activity 

- Profile the network, mean activity, enables us to see unusual activity
- Understand normal end user behaviour
- Create a log policy, where & whatâ€™s to be logged
- Correlate logs to SIEM
- Sync clocks
- Maintain knowledgebase of systems
- pCap as soon as a Incident begins
- Filter information to reduce noise and clutter
- Seek assistance from external resources if needed.
