# Recovery & Post-Incident Response – 8

### NIST SP 800-61 - Computer Security Incident Responce Guide

**1.	Preparation**  
**2.	Detection & Analysis**  
**3.	Contain, Eradicate & Recovery**  
**4.	Post Incident Activity**  

 -	**Segmentation** 
    -	Proactive network design 
    -	Can still reach the internet and be controlled by the attacker
    -	Can still effect other hosts within the same segmented network
 -	**Isolation**
    -	Put on a private VLAN
    -	Has internet access but cannot touch any other hosts
 -	**Removal**
    -	Killed – take offline  

**Identifying Attacker** – Only important if you plan to proceed with legal action. Law enforcement is getter able to identify people

## Incident Eradication & Recovery

### CompTIA vs NIST
Comptias differs from NIST process  

**NIST**  

> - **Containment**
> - **Eradication**
> - **Recovery**  

**Comptia**  

> - **Containment**
> -	**Eradication:** Sanitization, Reconstruction, Secure disposal
> -	**Validation:** Patching, Permissions, Scanning, Verify logs  

**Reconstructing & Re-Imaging:** going back to a base image or known good backup  

**Patching Systems & Application:** Patching should be prioritized  
1.	Systems directly involved
2.	Systems adjacent to compromise
3.	Other Systems
 
### Sanitization & Secure Disposal – NIST SP800 – 88
-	**Clear:** logical
    -	To erase all user addressable storage
    -	Factory reset or delete
-	**Purge:** logical/Physical
    -	Destroy by over writing storage
    -	block erase or cryptographically erace
    -	Degaussing magnetic storage 
-	**Destroy:** Physical
    -	Destroy the media, Destruction, Pulverization, Melting, Incinerating

After Clear/Purge/Destruction validation should be done to confirm the data is gone and a certificate of destruction issued.  

## Validate the Recovery Effort on Incident Response
1.	Validate only authorised user accounts exist in systems
2.	Verify the permissions for each account
3.	Verify that all systems are logging properly
4.	Conduct a vulnerability scan of system

### Conduct a Lessons Learned Session

Sit with all stakeholders to discuss future mitigation and lessons learned. Should be chaired by an independent person  

### Developing a Final Report
-	Timeline
-	Root cause analysis
-	Evidence collection
-	Actions Taken by agent
-	Estimated Impact
-	Recovery validation efforts
-	Document lessons learned
