# Software Development Security – 12


### Software Development Life Cycle – SDLC
1.	**Planning** – Initial Investigation
2.	**Requirements** – is a analysis & defining requirements
3.	**Design** – Design & Architecture
4.	**Development** – Actual development
5.	**Testing** – Integration testing, User acceptance, UAT
6.	**Training/Transition** – Ensure end users can use the software
7.	**Operation Maintenance** – Patching, updating support, modification
8.	**Desposition** - EOL

## Software Development Models

### Waterfall

- **Sequential** – One phase after the other

### Spiral

-	Linier
-	Risk Assessment Dominant 
-	Multiple risk reviews
-	Flexible to change

### Agile

-	Iterative & Incremental
-	Flexible to change 
-	Less document centric
-	Work broken into sprints
-	Based on 12 principles

### RAD – Rapid Application Development

-	Relies on building prototypes
-	No planed phases
-	Rapid deployment of finished products
-	5 phases

1.	Business modelling
2.	Data modelling
3.	Process modelling
4.	Application modelling
5.	Testing/turnover

### OWASP top proactive controls
-	Parameterized query’s
-	Encode data
-	Validate all inputs
-	Implement Identity & authentication controls
-	Implement Appropriate Access Controls
-	Protect Data
-	Implement Logging & Intrusion Detection
-	Leverage Security Frameworks & Library’s
-	Error & Exception Handling 

### SANS to 25 
-	Divided into 3 areas
1.	Insecure Interaction Between Components 
2.	Risky Resources Management
3.	Porous Defences 

### Application Testing 
1.	Scanning Tools & Vulnerability scans
2.	Manual penetration test
3.	Code reviews (static)

### Information Security and the SDLC
1.	**Feasibility** - Security will participate in the assessment
2.	**Analysis & Requirements** - Security Requirements
3.	**Design** - Include Security Architecture 
4.	**Development** - Secure testing, code reviews
5.	**Testing & Integration** - Vulnerability testing , additional code review
6.	**Training & Transition** - Security posture 
7.	**Operational Maintenance** -  Patching & upgrades
8.	**Disposition**  - Secure disposal
