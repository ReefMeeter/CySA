# Software Development Security – 12


### Software Development Life Cycle – SDLC
1.	**Planning** – Initial Investigation
2.	**Requirements** – is a analysis & defining requirements
3.	**Design** – Design & Architecture
4.	**Development** – Actual development
5.	**Testing** – Integration testing, User acceptance, UAT
6.	**Training/Transition** – Ensure end users can use the software
7.	**Operation Maintenance** – Patching, updating support, modification
8.	**Desposition** - EOL

-	Linier
-	Risk Assessment Dominant

### RAD – Rapid Application Development

-	Relies on building prototypes
-	No planed phases
-	Rapid deployment of finished products
-	5 phases

1.	Business modelling
2.	Data modelling
3.	Process modelling
4.	Application modelling
5.	Testing/turnover
