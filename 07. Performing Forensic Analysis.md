# Performing Forensic Analysis  - 7

## Building a Forensic Tool Kit  

**Key Components**
 -  Digital forensics workstation – plenty od ram
 - Forensic investigation suite (FTK, EnCase, SIFT, TSK)
 - Write Blocker
 - Write Blocker
 - Forensic drive duplicators
 - Wiped drives + removeable media
 - Cables & drive adapters
 - Camera
 
**Mobile Device Toolkit**
 - Sim cards
 - Flashcards
 - adapters (nano,mini,IOS)
 - Mobile forensic certification
 
## Understanding Forensic Software

**Slack space** - Room left in in space allocation after a file is written  

**Unallocated space** - Unused space  

### Analysing Utilities

 - Timeline of system changes
 - Check known good versions
 - File system analysis
 - Windows registry analysis
 - Log file parsing 
 
### Hashing Utilities

 - **Encase** uses E01 format which has built in hashing
 - **Linux** we use <code>sha1sum</code> or <code>md5sum</code>
 
### Operating System, Process, and Memory Dump Analysis

 - Encryption keys are kept in memory
 - Memory dump & memory capture can capture hibernation files + crash dumps which can unencrypt full disk encryption.
 
### Password Crackers

 - **AOPB** - Advanced Office Password Breaker – Cracks password encrypted files
 
### Crypto tools

## Conducting Investigations

1.	Determine what you are looking for 
2.	Outline where that data would be(logs, memory, filesystem)
3.	Create a review plan
4.	Acquire & preserve evidence
5.	Perform analysis
6.	Use initial analysis to guide further work
7.	Report findings

### Order of Volatility

1.	CPU Cache, Registries, Running Processes, Ram
2.	Network traffic
3.	Disk Drives
4.	Backups, Print outs, Optical media

## Acquiring & Validating Drive Images

 - Forensic copies include Unallocated & slack space
 - Bit for bit copy’s  
 
Linux <code>**dd**</code> utility gives bit for bit copies  

<code>**bs**</code> = Block size, <code>**if**</code> = InputFile, <code>**of**</code> = outputfile  

 - Verify images using a hash
 - use hardware write blockers  
 
Check USB device history – “USB Historian”  

### Capturing Memory Resident Data

 - **Linux** - Fmem or LiME
 - **Windows** - DumpIt
 - **Forensic Software** – Encase & FTK have memory tools
 
Core Dumps & Hibernation files may have encryption keys. We can use **WinDbg** to search these.  

### Acquisition of mobile phones

Immediately sever network connectivity  
1.	**Physical:** Sim card, memory cards, backups
2.	**Logical:** Image
3.	**Manual Access:** review unlocked phone
4.	**File System:** Check for deleted files

### Reporting
 - Goals & Scope
 - Targets
 - Findings & Results
